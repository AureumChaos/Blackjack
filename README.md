# Blackjack
A blackjack game, to test my programming skills.

First I installed MinGW, which is essentially a windows implementation
of the GNU compiler suite.  It also has a bunch of UNIXy tools called
MSYS, which I found to be pretty handy, including the make utility.

The install instruction are here: mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

I needed to download and install "git for windows"
Then I cloned https://github.com/AureumChaos/Blackjack.git
